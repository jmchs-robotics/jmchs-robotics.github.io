### Mission

We have entered into [FIRST Robotics Competition](http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) to help provide more options for students interested in applications of science, technology, and engineering at Judge Memorial Catholic High School. We aim to impact the student body by giving them the opportunity to learn and gain leadership and teamwork skills from participating as a part of our team.

### FIRST Robotics Competition

FIRST is an international organization started in 1994 by Dean Kamen and Woodie Flowers with the intent to inspire high school students to become science and technology leaders. Teams are given a unique competition each year and have six weeks to go from prototype to final product.
